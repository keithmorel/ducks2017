### What is OONO?
  The User makes a profile detailing their preferences for topics and basic info like likes, dislikes and hobbies. The user can then use their phone to spin a dial and find another user in their area that shares similar preferences and is facing their direction. Once matched, both users must agree to chat before any messages can be sent. After matching, you maintain a chat until one of you deletes the other.
